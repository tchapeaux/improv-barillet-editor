# Improv Barillet Editor

This project is intended for improv shows of the "Match" format (popular in the French-speaking world).In these shows, the referee prepares a "barillet" containing themes that will be drawn at random and played by the participants.

This tool allows the referee to prepare the barillet in advance and in the correct format, then to export it as PDF.
